# SP21-MedicMobile
# Setup 
1. `pip install virtualenv`
2. `python -m venv myvenv/`
3. `source myvenv/bin/activate`
OR `source myvenv/Scripts/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

# Instructions 
1. Upload .xml files into the *xml-files* directory 
2. Within the scripts directory, run: `python3 xml-parse.py`
  1. This function will parse every .xml file in the directory for their field names and produce empty .yaml files in the *yaml-files* directory
3. In the *yaml-files* directory, fill in each yaml file following guidelines written in the **DATATYPE KEYS** section of this document
  1. For each string field, create a new `.txt` file in the folder *yaml-files/default-text* which contains a list of strings to be sampled from
4. Within the *scripts* directory, run: `python3 data_generator.py`
  1. For detailed debugging, input `python3 data_generator.py --verbose`
5. Outputted synthetic datasets are within the synthetic-data directory


# Directory Structure
Explanation of the directory structure.
- **myvenv:** virtual environment initialization
- **scripts:** contains all executable python code for xml parsing and synthetic data generation
- **xml-files:** where users input xml files produced from forms
- **yaml-files:** contains empty .yaml files outputted from xml-parse.py. Users must manually fill out each .yaml file in this directory.
  - **default-text:** contains user inputted text files which have comma-separated string values which are sampled from in the data generator. Every string field in a .yaml file must contain a path to a specific file in this directory to sample values from.
- **synthetic-data:** contains outputted synthetic data files in the form of .csv



# Datatype Keys

## Floats 
Float values are sampled from 8 supported distributions generated by numpy.random sampling: normal, lognormal, uniform, binomial, poisson, beta, gamma, and exponential. 
Users input desired data types, distribution names and parameters, and constraints in a YAMl file. The inputs are parsed and passed through the float generator.

The inputs for a YAML file are detailed below. 

Rows: The number of data points the user wishes to generate. 
Type: The type of data the user wish to generate. In this case, the type is float.
Distribution: The name of the distribution the user wishes generate the data from and its corresponding parameters. 
Constraints(optional): The maximum and minimum values the user wishes to keep the generated data between. 

The supported distribution names and parameters are:
  -normal: mean, std
  -lognormal: mean, std
  -uniform: a, b 
  -binomial: n, p 
  -poisson: lam 
  -beta: alpha, beta 
  -gamma: shape, scale 
  -exponential: lam 

Examples of user inputs in a YAML file are shown:
```
rows: 100
heart_rate:
  constraints:
    min: 50
    max: 150
  distribution: 
    name: normal
    mean: 90
    std: 5
  type: float
```
```
blood_pressure:
  constraints:
    min: null
    max: 150
  distribution: 
    name: poisson
    lam : 120
  type: float
```

## Integers 
Integers are sampled using a Bernoulli distribution, as well as the 8 distributions used in the float generator function.
The int_generator function takes in a distribution, constraints, and size, which users can input in a YAML file. 

Type: Int
Distribution: Bernoulli(p) and supported float distributions.
Constraints(optional): The maximum and minimum values the user wishes to keep the generated data between. 

Examples of user inputs in a YAML file are shown:
```
patient_id:
  constraints: ~
  distribution: 
    name: bernoulli
    p: 0.5
  type: int
```
## Strings

Strings are randomly sampled using discrete integer probability distributions. Strings to sample from are specified by a comma-delineated .txt file 
in ./yaml-files/default-text/. This file should be referenced in the `string` attribute for the data column. Distributions supported include all distributions supported for integers.

Example:
```
province:
  constraints: ~
  distribution:
  name: normal
    mean: 50
    std: 2
  strings: ./default-text/province.txt
  type: string
```
Example of `province.txt`:

`Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan`

## Dates 

Type: Dates are being generated as a DateTime object.
Distribution: Dates are not being sampled from any type of distribution. 
Constraints: Users should input a range of years, in the form of a minimum year and a maximum year. Dates will be generated between this range of years.  -

Examples of user inputs in a YAML file are shown:
```
birthdate:
  constraints:
    min: 1900
    max: 2000
  distribution: ~
  type: date
```



# Current Issues/Further Improvements
* Dates are randomly generated without distribution.
* Does not take into constraints regarding relationship between birthdate and deathdate
* Do not currently have a multiselect datatype
